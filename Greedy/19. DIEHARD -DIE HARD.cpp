/*
Explanation:
Recursive Function:

maxSurvivalTime(health, armor, currentPlace) calculates the maximum time you can survive given the current health, armor, and the place you're currently in (currentPlace).
Base Case:
If health or armor becomes â‰¤ 0 return  0 because survival ends.
Recursive Case:
Depending on the current place, calculate the survival time for the next possible places:
Fire: Move to Air or Water.
Air: Move to Fire or Water.
Water: Move to Fire or Air.
Solve Function:

Starts from any of the three places and returns the maximum survival time.
Driver Code:

Reads input and solves the problem for each test case using the solve function.
